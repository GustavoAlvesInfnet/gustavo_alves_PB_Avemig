Through our unique local‑to‑global approach, we deliver high‑impact and long-term conservation for the benefit of nature and people.Together we are BirdLife International Partnership for nature and people www.birdlife.org 2 Making a Difference© Bjorn Olesen As we face a crisis that threatens nature, our climate, and our very existence, we all need to step up and change the way we treat our planet, our one home. We need to make a difference. Over the past 10 years the BirdLife Partnership has done just that. Working to a strategy agreed by the Partnership in 2013, we have protected species, conserved sites and habitats, pushed for environmental sustainability and worked with people towards our vision of a "world rich in biodiversity with people and nature living in harmony, equitably and sustainably". This 10‑year strategy was implemented through nine programmes, each with their own expected results, and monitored through a Quality Assurance System through which BirdLife Partners set baselines and reported against progress. Progress was reported on in 2016 through Making a Difference 1 and again in 2018 at the BirdLife Global Partnership Meeting. As we celebrate our 100th anniversary year, we are pleased to present Making a Difference 2 which is reporting back on some of our remarkable achievements over the past decade. These include overarching achievements in science and policy, our success in saving species from extinction and important sites under threat, our progress in the marine realm and for forests, and the progress we have made as a Partnership in building a grassroots civil
State of the World’s Birds 2022.txt:State of the World’s Birds 2022 Insights and solutions for the biodiversity crisisState of the World’s Bird s 2022 Contents 4 2 3 1 3This fifth edition of State of the World’s Birds summarises what birds tell us about the state of nature, the pressures upon it, and the solutions in place and needed. It focuses on birds because they are an excellent barometer for planetary health. Being widely distributed, relatively easy to survey, and responsive to environmental change, birds are useful biodiversity indicators, revealing wider trends in natural ecosystems. Owing to the cultural significance and enduring popularity of birds, there is an army of birdwatchers collecting data on them. BirdLife began documenting the status of birds and the threats to them exactly 100 years ago. Birds are therefore better known than any comparable group of organisms. This wealth of information paints a deeply concerning picture. One in eight bird species is threatened with extinction, and the status of the world’s birds continues to deteriorate: species are moving ever faster towards extinction. For those not yet considered threatened, the majority are in decline and have much-depleted populations. For example, 2.9 billion individual birds are estimated to have been lost in North America since 1970, and 600 million have been lost in the EU (an area five times smaller) since 1980. Furthermore, many key sites supporting bird populations – Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) – are in an unfavourable condition. The pressures causing these losses of our natural heritage are well understood, and the vast majority are driven by human actions. The principal threats include: agricultural expansion and intensification, unsustainable logging, invasive alien species, overexploitation and climate change. Additional threats include bycatch from fisheries, expanding residential and commercial development, the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires, and poorly planned energy production. Most species are impacted by combinations of these threats, and some threats exacerbate others. Fortunately, we know what actions are needed to reverse these losses and to help nature to recover. Most urgent is the conservation and effective management of the global network of IBAs, particularly through protected areas, or where appropriate through other effective area-based conservation measures. Conservation by Indigenous Peoples or local communities, either within or outside protected areas, is important for many sites. Beyond IBAs, it is essential to retain remaining intact habitats and restore degraded ecosystems, including to enhance connectivity. Key threats to the world’s

Birds are excellent environmental indicators. In this report, we synthesise data from birds to examine to what degree each Aichi Target was met, and to identify examples of positive trends and successes. Data from birds suggest that we have failed to meet in full any of the 18/20 Aichi Targets assessed: The underlying drivers of loss of nature remain, with biodiversity still not yet adequately mainstreamed across all sectors. Agriculture, forestry and fisheries continue to be managed unsustainably, driving habitat loss and degradation. Pollution, invasive alien species and climate change are growing threats to birds and other biodiversity.

State of Africa’s Birds_ Indicators for our changing environment (2018).txt:STATE OF AFRICA’S BIRDS Indicators for our changing environment An assessment from the BirdLife Africa Partnership Sokoke Scops Owl. (PHOTO: ©John Mwacharo)STATE OF AFRICA’S BIRDS Indicators for our changing environmentFOREWORD Biodiversity includes animals, plants and micro-organisms, the genes within them, the ecosystems in which they live, and the interactions among them.Birds are indicators of the environment: this means environmental changes can be detected by changes in the natural behaviour of bird species. In some parts of Africa, the presence of birds like Abdim’s stork Ciconia abdimii is associated with rain. Raptors or flesh-eating birds are high on the food chain and tend to accumulate pollutants deposited in the environment, making them suitable indicators for monitoring environmental pollution. Also, some bird species help identify priority areas where anthropogenic activities need to be carefully managed. The African continent’s rapid development had brought with it different changes and needs. These include high demand for space, road and rail networks, electricity and industrialization, more broadly. Burgeoning human populations have led to expanding and unsustainable agriculture and other forms of land use. Across the continent, the threats to birds and biodiversity have been increasing and the environment faces a matrix of challenges due to the changes that have followed development. Africa has a great need for infrastructure to spur development, whose role out should maximise the benefits of a rightly planned development. For example, the growing need for power and electricity to match Africa’s rate of development leads to increase in electricity power lines and wind farms (inspired by green energy). However, if these are not sited properly, they can cause harm to several African and migrant bird species through collision challenges. While there are benefits of having roads, ports or windmills constructed, the location of such infrastructure should be carefully put into consideration. Another growing concern is hunting and trapping of birds for traditional medicine, belief-based reasons (African vulture species in particular), domestic pets (for example African Grey Parrots) or game. These threats are pertinent across the continent. Poverty and inadequate appreciation of nature have also been cited as underlying challenges facing conservation in Africa. Many disenfranchised communities and the majority of the development sector are directly dependent on ecosystem services such as wood, water and arable land. This publication intends to put the spotlight on, and emphasize the need to conserve Africa’s biodiversity and ecosystem services. It demonstrates the possibilities for conserving biodiversity
Making a Difference (2016).txt:MAKING A DIFFERENCE The conservation impact of the BirdLife PartnershipBiodiversity is in decline across the world, with unsustain- able development destroying natural habitats and driving species extinct. This is reducing the capacity of our planet to sustain us into the future, and often causes the poorest in society to lose out. BirdLife International is playing a unique and critical role in tackling this crisis. BirdLife is the world’s largest nature conservation Partner- ship, comprising 120 national nature conservation organ-isations in 118 countries worldwide. Our unique structure – a democratic partnership of grassroots organisations – and the solid scientific foundation to our conservation programmes helps us to deliver high impact and long-term conservation that benefits both nature and people. Through a wealth of summary statistics and a selection of recent suc - cess stories, this report explores the many ways in which BirdLife is making a difference.We profile some of the key achievements of the BirdLife Partnership in recent years, and the conservation targets we collectively aspire to achieve by the end of the decade. These address conserving environments from the open ocean to tropical rainforests, tackling threats ranging from invasive alien species to climate change, and employing conservation approaches from species recovery to pro- tecting the most critical sites. The data quantifying these achievements derive from a recent systematic survey com-pleted by all BirdLife Partners. This review demonstrates that BirdLife is uniquely placed to deliver long-term sustainable solutions that are already providing substantial biodiversity benefits. With the support of donors, governments, businesses and civil society, we can scale up these successes and achieve substantial long-lasting benefits for nature and people. A partnership for nature The 120 BirdLife Partners have over 3 million members and over 7 million supporters. 4-5Safeguarding sites Over 2,000 of the most important sites for biodiversity directly benefited from action by BirdLife Partners since 2013. 6-7Saving seabirds Bycatch of albatrosses has been reduced by over 99% in some fisheries. 8-9 Preventing extinctions 483 threatened bird species have directly benefited from action by BirdLife Partners since 2013. 10-11Sustaining forests BirdLife is contributing to the conservation of nearly 2 million ha of forest. 12-13Conserving migratory species BirdLife Partners have taken action against the illegal killing of birds at 292 sites. 14-15 Tackling invasives During 2013-1015, 30 successful invasive alien species eradications took place. 16-17Combatting climate change BirdLife has developed community adaptation action plans at 59 of the most important
Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas_ A global network for conserving nature and benefiting people (2014).txt:Partnership for nature and peopleImportant B Ird and BIodIvers Ity areas A global network for conserving nature and benefiting people BIRDLIFE IMPORTANT BIRD AND BIODIVERSITY AREAI Four decades ofconservation action 2 Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas—IBAs—constitute the largest and most comprehensive global network of sites that are significant for the global persistence of biodiversity. Over the past four decades, IBAs have been extremely influential in helping governments and others to target conservation effort effectively and to identify the most important sites for designating as protected areas.Introduction—what are IBAs? Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) are sites of international significance for the conservation of the world’s birds and other biodiversity. They also provide essential benefits to people, such as food, materials, water, climate regulation and flood protection, as well as opportunities for recreation and spiritual fulfilment. Since the late 1970s, over 12,000 IBAs have been identified in virtually all of the world’s countries and territories, both on land and at sea. Many hundreds of protected areas have been designated as a direct consequence of their recognition as IBAs. IBAs have also had considerable and increasing relevance in developing responses to a number of wider environmental issues, such as habitat loss, ecosystem degradation, sustainable resource use and climate change. Why birds? tinyurl.com/casestudy79 The resources needed to comprehensively assess species richness and endemism patterns across all biodiversity are enormous. Birds provide a useful proxy for wider biodiversity because: ■ Their distribution and ecology is much better known than other comparable wildlife groups. ■ Their taxonomy is well known and relatively stable. ■ Bird populations are readily surveyed. ■ Birds are widespread, occurring almost everywhere. ■ Many bird species are specialised and have specific habitat requirements. ■ Birds are mobile and responsive to environmental changes. ■ There are enough bird species to show meaningful patterns, yet not so many as to make identification itself a significant challenge. ■ Birds are also unparalleled in their popularity—with local experts from every corner of the world documenting their distribution and status. The global IBA network identified for birds overlaps with the distributions of many other taxonomic groups. PHOTO Alexander Safonov, patsOn.livejournal.com 3Conserving IBAs is critical to preventing extinctions tinyurl.com/casestudy390 For some species, their very existence now depends on the effective conservation of the single remaining site in which they occur.
